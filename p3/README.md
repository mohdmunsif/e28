## Summary 

1. I think i would have benefited if i spent more hours on this (my poor time management unfortunately). 

Managed to use Vuex for the state management/single source of truth

2. Still not able to debug the issue with the URL appending after loading individual entry and going over to a different page/route. 

3. The favorite blog entries, i am using the logic being used in the Shopping cart, though there is a bug where my code is not loading the entries added to the favorite.

4. For new entry, there is a validation on the title, slug and entry - required fields.

5. Have tried using Netlify https://admiring-ptolemy-bb6df6.netlify.app/ , though not sure if i managed to create the right domain config using namecheap . it should be netlify.mohdmunsif.me .

6. Not able to incorporate any testing on my project.

7. The New Blog Entry, it worked before i added the validation, not sure why it is behaving strangely after i added field validation (and kind of late for me to debug it, fearing i will break other stuff)
